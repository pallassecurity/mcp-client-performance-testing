# MCP Client Performance Testing

The purpose of this repository is to test the performance of the MCP client in the Model Context Protocol official
Python SDK. We have experienced some issues with performance, particularly the
`mcp.client.streamable_http.streamablehttp_client` and `mcp.client.auth.OAuthClientProvider`.
